## Description
As a dog owner, we wanted to create a simple application to schedule a walk for our dog with trusted dog walkers when we are unavailable. 

We know that other apps like Rover already exist, but with all the horror stories that you hear, we want to eliminate the "stranger danger" aspect and have this app be for one dog walker or team of dog walkers that you know and trust.
